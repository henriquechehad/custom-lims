Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This repository contains the skeleton and all the boilerplate code required to
        create an extension package for Bika LIMS.
        
        By itself, this product simply installs bika.lims through the dependency
        specified in setup.py; there is no active working code in this package.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        1. Fork this repository on github.
        
        2. Clone your new forked repository to your local machine.
        
        3. Read and explore.
        
        You can rename the repository and package as you see fit, though neither of
        these things are relevant to the code's functioning.  In any text in this
        package, the name will be assumed to be "bika.custom".

        - archetypes.schemaextender is used for adding/removing/re-ordering fields,
        and for basically anything else related to modifying the AT schemas.  The
        readme can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/archetypes.schemaextender
